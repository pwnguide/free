Greetings fellow hackers!

Today, we will show you how to spoof your location using a HackRF One. <b>You will NEED a TCXO Clock for this to work.</b>

> Install the gps-sdr-sim program,
> Compile it using gcc,
> Get the satellite files,
> Run the program,
> Transfer it to the HackRF,
> Go to Antarctica!

## Installing The gps-sdr-sim Program

If you have git installed on your machine, then you can clone it using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/osqzss/gps-sdr-sim.git
```
Or by going to https://github.com/osqzss/gps-sdr-sim and downloading a zip and then extracting it.

Don't forget to get cd (get into the directory) before going to the next step!

### Compile it

Before you run the program, you have to compile it. You can do this by running:
```bash
gcc gpssim.c -lm -O3 -o gps-sdr-sim -DUSER_MOTION_SIZE=4000
```

Now comes the annoying part...

## Get The Satellite Files

To get the satellite files you sadly need to create an account on the NASA's website.

- Go to https://cddis.nasa.gov/archive/gnss/data/daily/2023/brdc/
- Find the latest file
- Download it
- And finally, extract it.

## Choose Where You Want To Be.
In my case, I want to be in Antarctica.
To do that, I will go to my favourite online map (like Google Maps),
Right click on the place where you want to be, and click on it's coordinates (see the image)

## Run The Program
Now you will need to create the .bin file with the gps-sdr-sim. Here's an example:
```bash
./gps-sdr-sim -b 8 -e brdc0010.22n -l -66.32458095460932, -62.33976614456196, 100
```
This will create a file named gpssim.bin.

## Transfer to The HackRF to Transmit
```bash
sudo hackrf_transfer -t gpssim.bin -f 1575420000 -s 2600000 -a 1 -x 0
```
Wooooo! You are now spoofing your location using a HackRF. If it doesn't work, then it may take about 3-5min to get recognised by your phone. Still not working? Because this tutorial is free, you can get community support by opening an issue here: https://github.com/pwnguide/free
