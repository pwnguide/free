# pwn.guide's list of free tutorials!
Do you like free tutorials? If you do, then please contribute to this repository with a tutorial in the .mdx format, and make it free and available to anyone!

# Why?
We created this repository because we don't really have free tutorials on our website. We believe in the power of free tutorials, especially for the people that can't normally afford them.

# What happens after I create a tutorial?
It goes like this:
1. It gets reviewed by our moderators
2. We tell you what to improve if anything
3. It gets commited to this reposiotory
4. It becomes available on our free tutorials section
5. That's probably it!
