# pwn.guide's list of free tutorials!
[![Uptime Badge](https://uptime.betterstack.com/status-badges/v1/monitor/wkbf.svg)](https://status.pwn.guide)

**Do you like free tutorials? If you do, then please contribute to this repository with a tutorial in the .mdx format, and make it free and available to anyone!**

## Why?
We created this repository because we don't really have free tutorials on our website. We believe in the power of free tutorials, especially for the people that can't normally afford them.

## What happens after I create a tutorial?
It goes like this:
* It gets reviewed by our moderators
* We tell you what to improve if anything
* It gets commited to this reposiotory
* It becomes available on [our free tutorials section](https://pwn.guide/tutorials)
* That's probably it!





## Why is this so awesome?

* People from poorer countries can learn the same stuff as you can
* You help improve the hacking space
* A lot more

## What does an example look like?
 
The example mdx file is titled "Example.mdx" in this repo.
